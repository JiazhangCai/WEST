# Weghted Ensemble method of Spatial Transcriptomics (WEST) 

## 1. Introduction 
WEST is a method that utilizes ensemble techniques to improve the performance and stability of spatial transcriptomics data analysis. 
It represents a significant advance in clustering spatial transcriptomics data, offering improved accuracy and flexibility compared to existing methods, 
making it a valuable tool for spatial transcriptomics data analysis.

## 2. Environment 
Python=3.8 
### Required packages: 

## 3.Tutorial 
The Jupytar Notebook [tutorial](https://github.com/JiazhangCai/WEST/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb) provides a tutorial of how to implement
WEST on an actual sample, including the description for every parameter. 

## 4. Data used in the paper 
All the datasets used in the paper, including the simulated datasets and the actual sample datasets, can be found in [data](). The code for 
generating the synthetic data is also provided in [simulation]().
